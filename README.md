#Codename: nested-hive

This proejct was created as a part of the BCHacks Hackathon. 

The idea is to create a chrome extension that allows the user to group sets of tabs together for quick and 
easy access. The user can then share these grouped tabs for other users to see and use.

For example, a user may wish to search for a set of links to learn more about Python. By searching 
*Learn Python* in the community database, lists of links can be easily accessed and opened.
